## What is so special about TEDAM?
TEDAM brings a new perspective to test automation:
- It organizes all UI interactions under action items and couples them with test data
- Its flexible architecture can be extended to support new action items
- It can support many scripting languages and frameworks
- It uses test steps and data as metadata/pseudo code to generate actual test script at runtime

## Who can use TEDAM?
TEDAM is used by Logo Business Solutions for test automation of its own software products. Originally it was created for test automation of [J-Platform](http://www.logo.com.tr/en/solutions/erp-solutions/j-platform) which is a full-fledged ERP solution using Java Web Start technology. Later it evolved to support HTML based web applications too. TEDAM currently supports only automated test execution.
